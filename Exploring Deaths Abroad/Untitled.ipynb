    "# Exploring American Deaths Abroad\n",
    "\n",
    "Having the opportunity visit a number of different countries for work and leisure, I was always make sure to research travel risks and stay aware of current news to keep myself safe. One of the resources I use is the U.S. State Dept website, featuring travel advisories and information of American non natural caused deaths overseas since October 2002. In this project, I will explore this dataset to answers questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -What country outside of the U.S. has the most deaths since 2002? In this decade, 2010s?\n",
    "    -What is the leading cause of overseas deaths?\n",
    "    -Is there a particular time of year where deaths are higher?\n",
    "    -Is there a particular time of year where certain types of deaths are higher?"

    "- \"Sec. 204(c) of P.L. 107-228, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003, mandates that, to the maximum extent practicable, the Department of State collect and make available on the Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs Internet web site certain information with respect to each United States citizen who dies in a foreign country from a non-natural cause. The information required is: (1) the date of death; (2) the locality where the death occurred; and (3) the cause of death, including, if the death resulted from an act of terrorism, a statement disclosing that fact. The information on the web site must be listed on a country-by-country basis, and must cover deaths occurring since the date of enactment of the legislation on September 30, 2002, or occurring during the preceding three calendar years, whichever period is shorter. The information is updated every six months.\"\n",

    "- \"Deaths that are listed as 'undetermined/unknown' have been reported to the Department of State as deaths from non-natural causes, but local authorities have not provided additional information.\"\n"
