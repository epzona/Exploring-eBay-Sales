# App Profile Recommendations

My aim for this project is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play English-speaking markets.This will allow a team of developers to make data-driven decisions with respect to the kind of apps they build.

Imagining a company that only build apps that are free to download and install, the main source of revenue for this company will consist of in-app ads. Revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users that use the app. By analyzing the data for Apple Store and google Play applications, I can see what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users in order to help developers focus on creating apps that will generate higher revenue.
