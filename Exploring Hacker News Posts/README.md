# Exploring Hacker News posts
In this project, I explore posts on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), a popular site where technology related stories (or 'posts') are voted and commented upon. The two types of posts I explore begin with either _Ask HN_ or _Show HN_. Specifically for this project, I want to answer the following:

* Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?
* Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
