For this project, I will be using the pandas and matlplotlib libraries to explore and visualize earnings based on college majors. The original data was poasted by American Community Survey, but was cleaned by FiveThirtyEight and posted on their https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors

Here are some questions I will be exploring in the dataset and how I will visualize the data:

- Do students in more popular majors make more money?
  - Using scatter plots
- How many majors are predominantly male? Predominantly female?
  - Using histograms
- Which category of majors have the most students?
  - Using bar plots
